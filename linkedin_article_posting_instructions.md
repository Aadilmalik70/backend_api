## What's the Difference Between a LinkedIn Post and Article?

**LinkedIn Post:**

**LinkedIn Article:**
- Long-form content (up to 125,000 characters)
- Has its own URL and is more discoverable via search
- Rich formatting options (headings, images, etc.)
- Better for thought leadership and in-depth content
- Remains prominently on your profile

## Best Practices for LinkedIn Articles

1. **Publish at optimal times:**
   - Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday between 8-10 AM or 1-2 PM typically see the highest engagement

2. **Engage with commenters:**
   - Respond to comments within 24 hours to boost the algorithm ranking

3. **Use the company page:**
   - Post the article from your personal account first
   - Then share it from your company page with additional commentary

4. **Track performance:**
   - LinkedIn provides article analytics including views, likes, comments, and shares
   - Use these insights to refine future content

5. **Repurpose strategically:**
   - After 1-2 weeks, repurpose sections of the article as standalone posts
   - This extends the life of your content and reaches different audience segments

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Formatting problems:** If formatting doesn't transfer correctly, try pasting as plain text first, then reapply formatting
- **Image upload issues:** If images won't upload, try reducing file size or using a different format (JPG instead of PNG)
- **Publishing errors:** If you encounter errors when publishing, save as draft, refresh the page, and try again

By publishing this as an article rather than a regular post, you'll establish stronger thought leadership, improve searchability of your content, and create a more permanent resource that showcases your expertise.
