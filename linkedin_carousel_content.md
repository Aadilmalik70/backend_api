# LinkedIn Carousel Content: SERP Strategist's Vision for the AI Search Era

## Slide 1: The AI Search Challenge

**Title:** The New SEO Reality: Google's AI Search Mode

**Copy:**
Google's AI search mode has changed everything.

• 70% of searches now show AI summaries first
• Click-through rates have dropped by up to 35%
• Traditional SEO tactics are becoming obsolete
• Brand visibility is at risk in "zero-click" results

Is your content strategy ready for this fundamental shift?

**Visual Concept:**
Split-screen design showing traditional SERP (left) vs. new AI summary interface (right). The traditional side shows familiar blue links with a highlighted #1 position. The AI side shows a prominent AI summary box above all results with a "buried" #1 organic result below it. Use a dramatic color contrast between the two sides to emphasize the paradigm shift.

## Slide 2: Introducing SERP Strategist's Vision

**Title:** Introducing SERP Strategist: The Team-First AI Search Optimization Platform

**Visual Concept:**
Central SERP Strategist logo with "The Team-First SEO Platform" tagline.
