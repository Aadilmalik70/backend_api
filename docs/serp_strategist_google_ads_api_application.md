# Google Ads API Token Application for SERP Strategist

## Company Name: SERP Strategist

## Business Model
SERP Strategist operates an AI-powered content strategy platform that helps content creators, SEO specialists, and marketing teams create content that dominates search results. We own and operate our platform at contentaigent.in. We only manage our own advertising campaigns and do not manage ads for third parties.

## Tool Access/Use
Our tool will be used by our internal marketing team to optimize our ad campaigns based on content performance data. We'll have a reporting dashboard for our team and the ability to generate PDF reports. These reports may be shared with our marketing consultants, but they will not have direct access to the tool.

We will implement an automated system that runs daily to adjust our ad spend based on content performance metrics from our platform.

## Tool Design
Our reporting system will pull metrics from the Google Ads API into our secure database. The UI will display this data in customizable dashboards showing content-to-ad performance correlations. Users can view different performance metrics across various timeframes.

Our internal system will sync with the Google Ads API daily to optimize campaign budgets based on content performance data from our platform, pausing underperforming campaigns and increasing spend on high-performing ones.

## API Services Called
- Manage campaign budgets via the CampaignBudgetService
- Pull account performance reports using the Customer resource

## Business Value
This integration will allow us to:
1. Directly correlate content performance with ad performance
2. Automatically adjust ad spend based on content engagement metrics
3. Provide our team with integrated reporting that combines SEO and PPC data
4. Optimize our marketing budget allocation in real-time

As the founder of SERP Strategist, I certify that we will comply with all Google Ads API policies and will only use the API for the purposes stated above.

Sincerely,
