Subject: Welcome to SERP Strategist! Here's Your Product Overview Guide

Hi [New Intern Name],

Welcome to the SERP Strategist team! I'm Aadil Khan, the Founder, and I'm thrilled to have you join our sales and marketing department. Your first few weeks are going to be exciting as you dive into our product and start connecting with potential customers.

I've attached our comprehensive Product Overview Guide that I personally use when onboarding new team members. This document will be your go-to resource as you learn about SERP Strategist and prepare for customer interactions.

A few quick things to know about us:

1. We're currently in waitlist phase with our MVP in active development
2. Our core value proposition is saving content teams time through AI-generated, data-driven content blueprints
3. What makes us unique is our agentic AI approach and deep research focus

The guide covers everything from our target personas to handling common objections, but don't feel overwhelmed! We'll go through this together in our 1:1 sessions.

For this week, please focus on:
- Reading through the Product Overview Guide
- Exploring our landing page at contentaigent.in
- Scheduling a demo walkthrough with me (just reply with some times that work for you)

I've also set up shadowing sessions for you with Priya from our sales team next Tuesday. She's fantastic with explaining our competitive advantages to prospects.

If you have any questions while going through the materials, don't hesitate to message me directly. No question is too smallâ€”we're all learning together as we build this product.

Looking forward to working with you!
