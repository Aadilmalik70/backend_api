# Python Intern Assignment: SERP Strategist

## Overview

Welcome to the SERP Strategist team! This assignment is designed to evaluate your Python skills and your ability to work with NLP, APIs, and data processing in the context of our AI-powered SEO platform.

SERP Strategist helps businesses optimize their content for both traditional search results and Google's new AI-powered search features. Your assignment focuses on building a component of our AI Summary Optimization Engine.

## Assignment: AI Content Structure Analyzer

### Objective

Create a Python module that analyzes content structure and evaluates its potential for inclusion in Google's AI summaries. The module should identify structural elements that make content more likely to be featured in AI-generated answers.

### Requirements

#### 1. Content Structure Analysis

Create a function that analyzes the structure of HTML or Markdown content and extracts:
- Heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Paragraph distribution and length
- List elements (ordered and unordered)
- Question-answer patterns
- Direct answer statements

#### 2. Entity Recognition

Implement entity recognition to:
- Identify named entities (people, places, organizations, products)
- Categorize entities by type
- Calculate entity density in the content
- Identify relationships between entities

#### 3. AI Summary Score Calculator

Create a scoring algorithm that:
- Evaluates content structure based on known AI summary patterns
- Assigns a score (0-100) indicating likelihood of inclusion in AI summaries
- Provides specific improvement recommendations
- Identifies the most summary-worthy sections of content

#### 4. API Integration

Build a simple Flask API that:
- Accepts content via POST requests
- Returns analysis results in JSON format
- Includes structure analysis, entity information, and summary score
- Provides specific recommendations for improvement

### Technical Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Use of appropriate NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK, etc.)
- Clean, well-documented code with docstrings
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Requirements.txt file for dependencies
- README with setup and usage instructions

### Bonus Points

- Integration with Google's Natural Language API
- Visualization of content structure
- Performance optimization for large content pieces
- Implementation of caching for repeated analysis
- Docker containerization

## Deliverables

1. GitHub repository with your code
2. README.md with:
   - Setup instructions
   - API documentation
   - Explanation of your approach
   - Limitations and future improvements
3. Example outputs for at least 3 different content samples (provided below)

## Sample Content for Testing

We've provided three sample content pieces for testing your implementation:
1. A how-to guide on website speed optimization
2. A product comparison article
3. A technical explanation of Google's search algorithm

These can be found in the `sample_content` folder.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:
1. **Functionality**: Does it work as expected?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, well-organized, and properly documented?
3. **Technical Decisions**: Are your library choices and implementation approaches appropriate?
4. **Analysis Accuracy**: How accurate and useful are the structure analysis and recommendations?
5. **API Design**: Is the API well-designed and easy to use?

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your completed assignment by:
1. Pushing your code to a GitHub repository
2. Sharing the repository link with us
3. Including a brief summary of your approach and any challenges you faced

## Time Expectation

This assignment is designed to take approximately 8-10 hours to complete. Please focus on functionality first, then improve and extend as time permits.

Good luck! We're excited to see your approach to this challenge.
