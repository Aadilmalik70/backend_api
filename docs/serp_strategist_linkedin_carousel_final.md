## Slide 1: The AI Search Challenge

**Title:** The New SEO Reality: Google's AI Search Mode

**Copy:**
Google's AI search mode has changed everything.

â€¢ 70% of searches now show AI summaries first
â€¢ Click-through rates have dropped by up to 35%
â€¢ Traditional SEO tactics are becoming obsolete
â€¢ Brand visibility is at risk in "zero-click" results

Is your content strategy ready for this fundamental shift?

**Visual Concept:**
Split-screen design showing traditional SERP (left) vs. new AI summary interface (right). The traditional side shows familiar blue links with a highlighted #1 position. The AI side shows a prominent AI summary box above all results with a "buried" #1 organic result below it. Use a dramatic color contrast between the two sides to emphasize the paradigm shift.
