## Implementation Details

### High-Priority Technical Improvements

1. **Dependency Management**
   ```bash
   # Create comprehensive requirements.txt
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   
   # Edit to organize and comment dependencies
   # Example structure:
   # Core dependencies
   flask==2.0.1
   flask-cors==3.0.10
   
   # API clients
   google-search-results==2.4.1
   
   # AI/ML
   langchain-google-genai==0.0.5
   sentence-transformers==2.2.2
   
   # Utilities
   python-dotenv==0.19.2
   ```

2. **Database Integration**
   ```python
   # Simple SQLite integration in app.py
   import sqlite3
   from flask import g
   
   DATABASE = 'keyword_research.db'
   
   def get_db():
       db = getattr(g, '_database', None)
       if db is None:
           db = g._database = sqlite3.connect(DATABASE)
           db.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
       return db
   
   @app.teardown_appcontext
   def close_connection(exception):
       db = getattr(g, '_database', None)
       if db is not None:
           db.close()
   
   # Initialize database
   def init_db():
       with app.app_context():
           db = get_db()
           with app.open_resource('schema.sql', mode='r') as f:
               db.cursor().executescript(f.read())
           db.commit()
   ```

3. **API Key Management**
   ```python
   # Enhanced API key validation
   def validate_api_keys():
       required_keys = {
           'GOOGLE_API_KEY': os.getenv('GOOGLE_API_KEY'),
           'SERPAPI_API_KEY': os.getenv('SERPAPI_API_KEY')
       }
       
       missing_keys = [key for key, value in required_keys.items() if not value]
       
       if missing_keys:
           logger.error(f"Missing required API keys: {', '.join(missing_keys)}")
