# Sample Data Validation Report

## Overview

This document verifies that the sample data provided for both the Python and React intern assignments is accurate, appropriate, and fully aligned with the assignment requirements.

## Python Intern Assignment Sample Data

### Alignment with Assignment Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Content Structure Analysis | ✅ Complete | Sample HTML files contain diverse heading structures, paragraphs, lists, and question-answer patterns |
| Entity Recognition | ✅ Complete | Samples include named entities (people, organizations, products, concepts) |
| AI Summary Potential | ✅ Complete | Content varies in structure and format to test summary algorithms |
| Multiple Content Types | ✅ Complete | Includes how-to guide, product comparison, and technical explanation |

### Technical Accuracy
