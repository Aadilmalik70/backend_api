# React Intern Assignment: SERP Strategist

## Overview

Welcome to the SERP Strategist team! This assignment is designed to evaluate your React skills and your ability to build interactive, data-driven interfaces for our AI-powered SEO platform.

SERP Strategist helps businesses optimize their content for both traditional search results and Google's new AI-powered search features. Your assignment focuses on building a component of our AI Summary Optimization Dashboard.

## Assignment: AI Summary Optimization Dashboard

### Objective

Create a React application that visualizes content structure analysis and provides an interactive interface for optimizing content for AI search summaries.

### Requirements

#### 1. Content Structure Visualization

Build a component that:
- Visualizes heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Shows paragraph distribution and length
- Highlights list elements and question-answer patterns
- Indicates sections most likely to appear in AI summaries
- Uses color coding to indicate optimization levels

#### 2. AI Summary Score Display

Create an interactive score display that:
- Shows the overall AI summary optimization score (0-100)
- Breaks down subscores for different factors (structure, entities, etc.)
- Provides visual indicators of strengths and weaknesses
- Updates in real-time as content is modified

#### 3. Recommendation Panel

Implement a recommendation panel that:
- Lists specific content improvement suggestions
- Allows users to apply recommendations with one click
- Groups recommendations by category (structure, entities, etc.)
- Tracks which recommendations have been implemented
- Shows estimated score improvement for each recommendation

#### 4. Content Editor Integration

Create a simplified content editor that:
- Allows basic text editing (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- Highlights sections as they're being edited
- Shows real-time optimization feedback
- Integrates with the score display and recommendation panel

### Technical Requirements

- React 18+
- TypeScript
- State management (Redux, Context API, or similar)
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design (mobile and desktop)
- Clean, well-documented code
- Unit tests for core components
- README with setup and usage instructions

### Bonus Points

- Use of data visualization libraries (D3.js, Chart.js, etc.)
- Animations and micro-interactions
- Advanced editor features (markdown support, formatting toolbar)
- Accessibility considerations (WCAG compliance)
- Performance optimization techniques

## Deliverables

1. GitHub repository with your code
2. README.md with:
   - Setup instructions
   - Component documentation
   - Explanation of your approach
   - Limitations and future improvements
3. Deployed demo (GitHub Pages, Vercel, or similar)

## Sample Data

We've provided sample API responses in the `sample_data` folder that include:
1. Content structure analysis
2. AI summary scores
3. Optimization recommendations

Your application should use this data to populate the interface.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:
1. **Functionality**: Does it work as expected?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, well-organized, and properly typed?
3. **Component Design**: Are components reusable, properly separated, and well-structured?
4. **UI/UX Design**: Is the interface intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing?
5. **State Management**: Is application state managed effectively?

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your completed assignment by:
1. Pushing your code to a GitHub repository
2. Deploying a working demo
3. Sharing both links with us
4. Including a brief summary of your approach and any challenges you faced

## Time Expectation

This assignment is designed to take approximately 8-10 hours to complete. Please focus on functionality first, then improve and extend as time permits.

Good luck! We're excited to see your approach to this challenge.
