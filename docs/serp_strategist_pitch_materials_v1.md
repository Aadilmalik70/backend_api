## 2. Elevator Pitch (Approx. 45-60 seconds)

"Creating content that actually ranks high on Google is incredibly complex and time-consuming. Businesses struggle to understand search intent, analyze competitors effectively, and build comprehensive content strategies – often wasting resources on content that never gets seen.

SERP Strategist tackles this head-on. We're building an AI-powered platform, but unlike other tools, we use an **Agentic AI approach** to perform deep, strategic research – much like a human expert would, but faster and at scale. Our core product generates highly detailed content blueprints that tell you exactly what topics to cover, questions to answer, and how to structure your content to dominate the SERPs for your target keywords.

We've launched our landing page, started building a waitlist, and are onboarding our first early users now. Our vision is to evolve SERP Strategist into an autonomous AI agent managing the entire content creation lifecycle. We're seeking [Your Funding Ask Amount] in pre-seed funding to finalize our MVP, fix key technical integrations, and accelerate our initial customer acquisition efforts."
