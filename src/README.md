# Overview

This tool is used by Willâ€™s Widgets staff to manage and report on online ads for our own websites. It helps us:

- See how our ads are performing.
- Generate reports for our team and partners.
- Make sure ads are only running for products that are in stock.

**Why do we need the Google Ads API?**

We use the Google Ads API so we can:
- Automatically pause ads when products go out of stock.
- Pull ad performance data into our reports and dashboard.

Only our employees use this tool directly. Reports can be shared with our advertising partners, but they do not have access to the tool itself.
